        It’s one thing to say you have good dog breeders, but it’s another thing to prove and promise it! Finding the right puppy is a lot like falling in love…when you know, you just know! Every single one of the customers we agree that it’s the puppy’s health, happiness, and well being that matters most. <br /><br />

        At legacy kennels we don’t just sell puppies to the first person to show up with cash in hand. Just like how you want a breeder to take optimal care of your future puppy, good breeders want to ensure they’re sending their pups home with a family who will love them well for the rest of their lives! For this reason, the ethical dog breeding at Legacy kennels reserve the right to deny the sale to anyone they suspect may be unfit to do so. By keeping this rule in place, we believe we can help puppies, customers, and our kennel have the best possible experience.

        <p className="select-none text-gray-500 sm:text-lg mb-6 md:mb-8">We are currently breeders of the mighty majestic South African Boerboel dog breed. On our team is a veterinarian and a biologist with a dedicated team of workers who insure the kennel is clean and disease free. At Legacy kennel we don’t breed and hope for the best, there is an extremely vigorous selection process that is carried out, by ourselves, regarding temperament and conformation before any animal is selected to breed with them. Our boerboels are very well socialized and although their natural guarding instincts are very much still there, once introduced to new people and new things, in the correct manner, they are accepting with minimal fuss.</p>
